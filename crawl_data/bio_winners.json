This class sparked Sperry's interest in the brain and how it can change.  Stetson was disabled and had trouble getting around so Sperry would help him out by driving him to and from wherever he needed to go.  This included taking Stetson to lunch with his colleagues.  Sperry would just sit at the end of the table and listen to Stetson and his colleagues discuss their research and other psychological interests.  This increased Sperry's interest in Psychology even more and after he received his undergraduate degree in English from Oberlin he decided to stay and get his master's degree in Psychology. He received his bachelor's degree in English in 1935 and a master's degree in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology\" title=\"Psychology\">psychology</a> in 1937.

He had no laboratory of his own, but used several laboratories, for example that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Friedel\" title=\"Charles Friedel\">Charles Friedel</a>.
